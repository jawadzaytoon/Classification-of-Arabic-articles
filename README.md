# Classification of Arabic articles

## Abstract:

This paper investigates the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to automatically classify Arabic articles into five categories: sport, politics, culture, economy, and diverse. The proposed method uses natural language processing techniques to extract the key features of the articles and apply machine learning algorithms to classify them. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated on a dataset of Arabic articles and the results show that it achieves an accuracy of 94.7%. The proposed method can be used to facilitate the analysis of larger datasets and provide more accurate insights into the topics of interest, and This paper presents an approach to classify Arabic articles using Artificial Intelligence (AI). The proposed approach combines natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) techniques to classify Arabic articles into their respective categories. 

## project overview:

 This project is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) project that will use machine learning (ML) algorithms to analyse text data and extract valuable insights. The goal of this project is to develop a reliable and accurate system that can process large amounts of text data in a short amount of time. 

 The project will include tasks such as text pre-processing, tokenization, sentiment analysis, topic modelling, text classification, and summarization. To accomplish these tasks, we will use various algorithms such as Decision Tree Classifier, SVM, and Random Forest. We will also use other techniques such as stemming, lemmatization, stopword removal, and word embeddings.

The project will be implemented using Python and the necessary libraries such as Scikit-Learn, and NLTK.  

The project will start by creating a dataset of text data for the ML algorithms to process. We will also create a set of labelled data for supervised learning tasks. Once the datasets are ready, we will use the ML algorithms to train and evaluate the models.

Once the models are trained, we will deploy them in a production environment. We will also use the models to generate insights from the text data.
Finally, we will evaluate the models and present the results of the project


The main difference between these two AI projects is the technology used for Arabic articles classification. My project uses natural language processing (NLP) for its classification, while the other project uses machine learning algorithms. 

In the project that uses NLP, the natural language processing algorithms analyse the text of the articles and classify them into the desired categories. This method is usually faster and more accurate than other methods, such as manual classification. On the other hand, the project that uses machine learning algorithms relies on using statistical models to classify the articles. This approach can be slower and less accurate than NLP, but it can also be more robust and accurate if properly configured. 

In conclusion, the two AI projects differ mainly in the technology used for Arabic articles classification. The NLP-based project is usually faster and more accurate, while the machine learning-based project is slower but more robust and accurate.


## methodology:

The following steps are typically used when developing an AI application with Natural Language Processing (NLP):

1. Data Collection: Collect data that is relevant to the task at hand. This data can come from text, audio, or video sources.

2. Pre-processing: Pre-process the data, which typically includes cleaning the data, tokenizing the text, removing stop words, and vectorizing.

3. Model selection: Select an NLP model, such as a deep learning model, for the task, and fine-tune the parameters for better performance.

4. Training and Tuning: Train and tune the chosen model. This might involve split testing using different datasets.

5. Evaluation: Evaluate the model using metrics such as accuracy.


## Data 

The dataset is a collection of Arabic texts, which covers modern Arabic language used in newspapers articles. 

The dataset consists of 111,728 documents and 319,254,124 words structured in text files, and collected from 3 Arabic online newspapers: Assabah , Hespress  and Akhbarona  using semi-automatic web crawling process.

The documents in the dataset are categorized into 5 classes: sport, politic, culture, economy and diverse. The number of documents and words for each class varies from one class to another .

## NLP Model: 

NLP (Natural Language Processing) is a branch of artificial intelligence that deals with analysing, understanding, and generating human language. NLP is an evolving field at the intersection of computer science, linguistics, and artificial intelligence.

The NLP Model is an architecture that explains how computers process and understand natural language, accounting for the complexity of human language. The model consists of four basic components:
1. Lexical Analysis: Identifying and sorting the linguistic units (words, phrases, and/or sentences) used in a natural language.
2. Syntax Analysis: Analysing the structure (grammar) of the words and phrases to determine their meaning.
3. Semantic Analysis: Reasoning about the meanings of words and phrases to determine the content or meaning of a sentence.
4. Pragmatic Analysis: Interpreting and filtering the text to determine the intention behind the words.

## understanding the project:

Word processing and compilation using natural language processing (NLP) is a project that uses NLP techniques to process, compile and ultimately better understand textual data. This project involves using algorithms and natural language processing (NLP) techniques to extract and identify important words from a large corpus of text. It also includes identifying important phrases and extracting sentiment, which is the sentiment or stance of the text. The intention of this project is to create a large database of potential keywords or topics associated with a text, enabling further exploration of that topic. Ultimately, this could be used in a variety of ways, such as in text-mining, semantic analysis, or topic modelling.
